# Wagtail AI

Wagtail AI integrates Wagtail with OpenAI's APIs (think ChatGPT) to help you write and correct your content.

Right now, it can:

* Finish what you've started - write some text and tell Wagtail AI to finish it off for you.
* Correct your spelling/grammar.
* Generate image descriptions - useful for [image alt text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt).
* Let you add your own custom prompts.
